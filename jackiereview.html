<h3>I have an eye for the underappreciated. When I find a film that's been given the label "underrated," I have to find out why. Just why did this movie fly under everyone's radar? Especially, when it comes from a successful filmmaker like Quentin Tarantino. After watching this movie several times, I'm still asking that same question.</h3>
<h3>Jackie Brown (played by Pam Grier) is a flight attendant/associate of a local crook by the name of Ordell, portrayed by Tarantino regular, Samuel L. Jackson. Through unfortunate circumstances, Jackie's has to cooperate with the federal government so they can put Ordell behind bars, while trying to stay on Ordell's good side. That is until she can rip him off for half a million bucks.</h3>
<h3>From beginning to end, JACKIE BROWN is engaging, smart and entertaining. This is a movie that's both familiar and new for those Tarantino fans that haven't seen this yet. As for those who haven't seen his movies, this is what I'd like to call a "soft" introduction to his style of filmmaking. Within the rest of Quentin's films you can find, over the top violence and a mountain of profane language. Though there are a couple of f-bombs dropped in JACKIE BROWN, the violence is tone down to a considerable level. Though a trademark in all of his movies is a lot of dark humor and JACKIE BROWN is no exception. There's a death scene in this movie that still cracks me up for some unknown reason. A lot of this movie can't be possible without Tarantino's direction and his star-studded cast.</h3>
<h3>The cast includes previously mentioned Grier, and Jackson, while also starring Robert Forester, Michael Keaton and a timid Robert De Niro. I can honestly say that Quentin is an absolute genius when it comes to picking his actors. He can bring out the best out of anyone who joins his projects, and he does it again in this film, though of course that magic has always been around, if your a fan of Tarantino's work, then you know what I'm talking about. Also he has a great thing for music as well.</h3>
<h3>If you're still wandering what my opinion is of this movie, it's this: It's a great film, if your looking for a long, well-directed movie, then you should see this movie and if your looking for something fast-paced, then you should look somewhere else.</h3>
<h3>FINAL RATING:</h3>
<div class="w3-center"><img src="imgs/4.5_Stars.jpg" alt="stars" style="width: 55%"></div>
<h3>JACKIE BROWN is currently available on  Blu-Ray and DVD. You can easily find it in any video store in the U.S. I'm not sure about other regions of the world, but I'm confident you'll find it. It's well worth your time and money. Alternate Recommendations: INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, it has a lot of qualities that many Tarantino fans are familiar with and lastly, I recommend, THE HATEFUL EIGHT, the latest film from Quentin and it does not disappoint.</h3>
<h3>Until Next Time, Have a Royal With Cheese on Me...</h3>
