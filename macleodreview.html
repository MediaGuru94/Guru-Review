<h3>"I have an eye for the underappreciated" that line from my JACKIE BROWN review applies to many of my personal favorite films including 9 (2009), PAPRIKA (2006), THE NAKED GUN (1988) and in my opinion THE greatest fantasy film from the '80s: HIGHLANDER (1986).</h3>
<h3>The setting: New York City. The event: THE GATHERING. The time when all of the remaining immortals come together, and battle to the last, to fight for THE PRIZE. Among them is a man by the name of Connor Macloud, who like many of the others has lived many secret lives waiting for this very moment. As the Gathering unfolds, this draws the attention of NYPD forensics specialist, Brenda Wyatt, who soon gets caught in-between, but does not hesitate to find out the truth. What will she find? Something spectacular or something deadly, in the end there can be only one!</h3>
<h3>HIGHLANDER is in a word: simple. A simple premise, simple characters, but amazing action, from beginning to end. While calling the characters simple may sound disheartening, they're anything but that, due to the performances in this film. The real show-stealers are Sean Connery (Macloud's mentor) and Clancy Brown (the film's big baddie), both put in a great amount of effort into their parts and have such charisma you can't help but enjoy every second of them. That isn't to say Macloud himself is not horrible. Christopher Lambert, who plays the Scottish immortal, has this other-worldly presence that makes him unpredictable and gives off the impression that he has seen A LOT of stuff in his life, despite his weird accent (Fun Fact: prior to filming, Lambert didn't speak any English).</h3>
<h3>So, if you're a LORD OF THE RINGS fan (or a fantasy fan in general) and are looking for something different, then you should definitely check out HIGHLANDER. (P.S. most of the songs in the film are performed by Queen!)</h3>
<h3>Final Rating:</h3>
<div class="w3-center"><img src="imgs/4_Stars.jpg" alt="stars" style="width: 55%"></div>
<h3>HIGHLANDER is available on Blu-Ray and DVD, online and at your local video store. I'd recommend buying the "director’s cut" (which is actually the European version of the movie), there's really no other version of this film I'd rather watch, for alternate recommendations, I first point you towards another fantasy flick from the '80s, THE PRINCE'S BRIDE, a classic love story with amusing swordfights and hilarity abound and lastly I recommend checking out, JOHN WICK, a movie with an over-used revenge plot with action that is nothing short of astounding.</h3>
<h3>Until Next Time, Don’t Lose Your Head…</h3>
