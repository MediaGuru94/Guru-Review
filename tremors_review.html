<h3>Everyone loves a good monster movie every once and a while. Me, I am a huge fan of monster movies, especially the ones from Japan. I grew up with these kinds of creatures, gigantic spawns created by nuclear-radiation who's only purpose is to cause mass destruction. When it comes to giant monster films, TREMORS is no exception.</h3>

<h3>The movie takes place in the fictional town of Perfection, Nevada, where the residents are terrorized by enormous subterranean monsters that can sense their every move. Now, the townspeople must ban together if they’re going to survive this. Among them are two handymen that decided to "leave this place just one damn day too late."</h3>

<h3>This movie has quite the cast, it includes Kevin Bacon, Fred Ward and Michael Gross. Over the years, Gross has become the poster boy of the series (they made five of these movies total) and he's one of my personal favorite movie characters of all time. Michael Gross plays Burt Gummer, a survival freak and gun enthusiast (note, enthusiast is only putting it lightly). He's one of the film's most memorable characters, that alone is not an easy task, considering that Kevin Bacon's in it as well. Despite its cast, the movie has plenty of horror clichés, including false jump scares and bad decision making. The beauty of this movie is the way the characters handle the clichés, when an annoying kid creates a panic, Fred Ward's character warns the kid to cut it out or else.</h3>

<h3>If you’re looking for a non-conventional monster film, this is the one for you.</h3>

<h3>Final Rating:</h3>
<div class="w3-center"><img src="imgs/4_Stars.jpg" alt="Stars"></div>

<h3>You can find this at your local video-store, on Blu-Ray and DVD, for a decent price these days. For alternate recommendations I point you towards the sequel, TREMORS 2: AFTERSHOCKS, it's a great continuation that builds upon what made the first movie great and lastly, I highly recommend checking out <a href="startroops_review.html">STARSHIP TROOPERS</a>, it's on the more militaristic side, but still has same, awesome B-Movie feeling TREMORS has.</h3>

<h3>Until Next Time, Watch Out for Prairie Dog Holes...</h3>
